My first Digital-clock project. I learnt this from a youtuber named "JavaScript King". I started having error with 
my css as my display: flex; did not want to load, then i got some help and realised that i needed to add a housing
div so that my time in the browser can vertically align. I also had errors with my js but i could not see it and
later realised i had incorrect spelling so my clock could not got live in the browser.

I have added a link to my live digital clock.
